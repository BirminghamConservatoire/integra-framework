# Integra Framework

The Integra Framework consists of libIntegra, a shared [dynamically loaded library](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_loading) and a set of data files consumed by the library. Further information about libIntegra can be found [here](http://birminghamconservatoire.github.io/IntegraLive/api-documentation/).

The additional files that form part of the framework are:

- The Integra core modules
- Schemas for libIntegra's data files
- Any other dependencies required by libIntegra
- The libIntegra public headers (macOS only)

### Source Code

-   Download source tree from Git
	[https://github.com/BirminghamConservatoire/integra-framework](https://github.com/BirminghamConservatoire/integra-framework "https://github.com/BirminghamConservatoire/integra-framework")

The repository contains a submodule for certain dependencies.  To download these submodules, use the git command:

`git submodule update --init --recursive`


## Building on macOS

On macOS the Integra framework builds as a [framework](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/MacOSX/Conceptual/BPFrameworks/Concepts/WhatAreFrameworks.html). The built framework includes the libIntegra dynamically linked library, any non-system dependencies, the core Integra module library and any assets or data files required by libIntegra.

To build the Integra framework on macOS:

- Open libIntegra/xcode/Integra/Integra.xcodeproj
- Select the Integra.framework build target from the target selector
- Select Product -> Build

This will create a **Debug** build of the Integra.framework in the built products output directory

To build a **Release** build, either select "Build for Profiling" from the Product menu or change the Build Configuration in the Scheme Editor

### Testing

To run the test suite:

- Select the UnitTests target from the target selector
- Select Product -> Run


## Building in Windows

On Windows the framework builds as a collection of [dll](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic-link_library)s and other files that are copied to a common directory at the end of the build process. All files in this output directory must be available to the libIntegra.dll at runtime.

### Prerequisites

-   Install Visual Studio (2017 or later)
-   Install the [Test Adapter for Google Test](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/test/how-to-use-google-test-for-cpp?view=vs-2017) (needed for unit tests)
-   Install the [Windows WDK](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/hardware/windows-driver-kit
)
-   Install [mingw](http://www.mingw.org) (including msys, gcc and pthreads). The easiest way to do this is to download the mingw installer and install the mingw32-base-bin, msys-base and mingw32-pthreads-w32 meta packages

### Environment Variables

-   C:\MinGW\msys\1.0\bin should be in the PATH variable
-   C:\MinGW\bin should be in the PATH variable

### ASIO SDK

The ASIO SDK is needed in order provide low-latency audio I/O in windows.  The ASIO SDK is published by Steinberg, who do not permit the redistribution of its source code.  So you need to download it from [http://www.steinberg.net/nc/en/company/developer/sdk_download_portal.html](http://www.steinberg.net/nc/en/company/developer/sdk_download_portal.html "http://www.steinberg.net/nc/en/company/developer/sdk_download_portal.html"), and extract it to libIntegra/externals/portaudio/src/hostapi/asio/ASIOSDK.

### Set Flext build properties

In order for the libIntegra build system to locate required headers for the Flext dependencies:

- Copy the file libIntegra/msvc/flext_settings_VS.props to libIntegra/externals/flext

**This will overwrite the existing flext_settings_VS.props in libIntegra/externals/flext**. Because this file is tracked by git, it will therefore show up as modified in the git staging area. To ignore these local changes, use:

`git update-index --skip-worktree libIntegra/externals/flext/flext_settings_VS.props`

The changes will then be ignored by git.

### Building the Visual Studio solution

Once the above requirements have been satisfied, it should be trivial to build the Integra Framework.

- Open libIntegra/msvc/libIntegra.sln
- Build the solution

The output files will be placed in libIntegra/bin

### Testing

To run the test suite:

- Select from the Test menu: Run -> All Tests

## Reporting issues

Issues should be reported on the project [issue tracker](https://github.com/BirminghamConservatoire/integra-framework/issues)

## Porting notes

Many of libIntegra's dependencies were originally developed within a Unix or Linux ecosystem. These include libPd, Flext, libxml2 and the pthreads library. Whilst it is possible to compile these on Windows, it makes the libIntegra build system under Visual Studio somewhat complex. A future goal of the project is to factor out some of these dependencies so that building the framework can be simplified across different platforms.
